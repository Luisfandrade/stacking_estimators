# Stacking Estimators
A simple exploration of the benefits of stacking ML estimators applied to the iconic Titanick dataset

## Context
* Stacking is the process by which several estimators are leveraged in order to produced a combined prediction that achieves the best performance
* Stacking has been shown to perform well in a large variety of data science problems

## Objectives
* To implement a stacking of several well-known shallow estimators
* To apply the stacking result to the [Titanick survival](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) problem and evaluate its performance

## Dataset

The Dataset is the famous Titanick survival data, which contains information about the passengers that were onboard of the titanick. This dataset also includes whether the passenger survived or not, which in this case will be considered the target variable. 

The dataset contains hundreds of passengers with a total of 12 fields
